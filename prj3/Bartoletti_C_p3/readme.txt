Every test case is satisfied except for the medium input backtracking. The program was
taking a very long time to run and I did not want my connection to remote.cs to time
out so I did not run it to completion. I am fairly sure the algorithm is poorly optimized,
however it is possible there is an infinite loop. My backtracking algorithm works for the
other test cases.

I have done this assignment completely on my own. I have not copied it, nor have I given my solution to
anyone else. I understand that if I am involved in plagiarism or cheating I will have to sign an official form
that I have cheated and that this form will be stored in my official university record. I also understand that
I will receive a grade of 0 for the involved assignment for my first offense and that I will receive a grade of
“F” for the course for any additional offense.
